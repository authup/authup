# Testing

## Setup

- **Runner**: Vitest with SWC compiler for fast transpilation
- **Test location**: `test/unit/**/*.spec.ts` within each package/app
- **Config**: `test/vitest.config.ts` per package/app
- **Prerequisite**: `npm run build` before running tests

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run build                                  # required before testing
npm run test                                   # test all apps/packages
npm run test --workspace=apps/server-core      # test a single app/package
npm run test --workspace=apps/server-core -- test/unit/core/entities/role/service.spec.ts  # run a specific test file
```

### Database-Specific Tests (server-core)

```bash
npm run test:mysql --workspace=apps/server-core
npm run test:psql --workspace=apps/server-core
```

## Test Layers (server-core)

### Service-Level Tests

Location: `test/unit/core/entities/{entity}/service.spec.ts`

Test business logic in isolation using fake repositories (in-memory) and mock permission checkers. No HTTP, database, or Docker required. Tests run in ~1ms each.

Helpers in `test/unit/core/helpers/`:
- `FakeEntityRepository<T>` — in-memory `IEntityRepository` backed by an array
- `FakeRealmRepository` — in-memory `IRealmRepository` with `resolve()` and a pre-seeded master realm
- `createAllowAllActor()` / `createDenyAllActor()` — mock `ActorContext` for permission testing
- `createMasterRealmActor()` / `createNonMasterRealmActor(realmId)` — presets with identity for realm defaulting tests

What to test: permission gates, validation, realm defaulting, uniqueness, built-in entity protection, upsert behavior, error paths.

**Writing philosophy:** Tests should assert *expected* behavior based on the service contract and architecture docs — not merely confirm what the implementation currently does. If a test fails, it may surface a real bug in the implementation rather than a test error. When a test failure seems like it could be a legitimate implementation issue, flag it to the user before "fixing" the test. The tests are a verification tool, not a rubber stamp.

**Important:** The vitest config lives at `test/vitest.config.ts`, not the project root. Running `npx vitest run` directly from the workspace directory will **not** find the config and **skips the global setup** (`test/setup.ts`), which provisions the master realm and starts Docker containers.

- **Always use** `npm run test --workspace=apps/server-core` (from repo root) or `npx vitest run --config test/vitest.config.ts` (from workspace directory)
- Service-level tests (`test/unit/core/entities/`) don't need the global setup and work without it
- Integration tests (e.g., `test/unit/core/identity/provider/account.spec.ts`) **require** the provisioned database from the global setup and will fail without it

### HTTP-Level Tests

Location: `test/unit/http/controllers/entities/{entity}.spec.ts`

Integration tests that spin up the full application (database, HTTP server). Test HTTP client compatibility (`core-http-kit`), request/response shaping, middleware pipeline, and end-to-end wiring. Require Docker services.

`test/app/http.ts` exposes:
- `suite.client` — a typed `@authup/core-http-kit` `Client` pointed at the running test server with admin Basic auth.
- `suite.baseURL` — the `http://localhost:<random-port>` URL of the test server, useful for raw `fetch()` calls when the typed client doesn't fit (e.g., asserting on HTML response bodies).

### Testing UI / SSR with a fake HTTP client

For tests that exercise the SSR'd consent UI at `/authorize` (or any future code path that mounts the bundled Vue app), you cannot let the SSR's internal HTTP calls reach a real server — `config.publicUrl` defaults to `:3001` while the test server runs on a random port, and the dangling fetches leak unhandled rejections.

The supported pattern (see plan 003 once implemented) is:

```ts
import { createFakeClient } from '@authup/core-http-kit/testing';

const fakeHttpClient = createFakeClient({
    handlers: {
        'GET /clients/:id': ({ params }) => ({ id: params.id, name: 'Test' }),
        'GET /scopes': () => ({ data: [], meta: { total: 0 } }),
        '*': () => ({ data: [], meta: { total: 0 } }),
    },
});
```

The fake is wired into the SSR via the optional `httpClient` parameter on `@authup/client-web-kit`'s `install()`. Production code never imports from `@authup/core-http-kit/testing`.

## Code Coverage

### Generate coverage report

```bash
npm run test:coverage --workspace=apps/server-core
```

This runs all tests with coverage collection and outputs:
- Console summary table (truncated folder names, hard to read for specific files)
- `apps/server-core/coverage/coverage-final.json` — detailed JSON report

### Query coverage for specific modules

After running `test:coverage`, use this from `apps/server-core/`:

```bash
node -e 'var cov=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync("./coverage/coverage-final.json","utf8"));var files=Object.keys(cov).filter(function(f){return f.indexOf("PATTERN")>-1&&f.endsWith(".ts")});files.sort();files.forEach(function(f){var d=cov[f];var stmts=Object.values(d.s);var total=stmts.length;var covered=stmts.filter(function(v){return v>0}).length;var pct=total?Math.round(covered/total*100):0;var idx=f.lastIndexOf("core");var short=f.substring(idx);console.log(pct+"% ("+covered+"/"+total+") | "+short)})'
```

Replace `PATTERN` with a path fragment to filter files. Examples:
- `core\\\\entities` — all entity service/type files
- `core\\\\oauth2` — OAuth2 module
- `core\\\\identity` — registration and password recovery
- `core\\\\entities.*service` — only service implementation files

**Note:** Windows paths use `\\\\` (double-escaped backslash) in the filter string.

### Coverage targets

| Layer | Current | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Core entity services (`core/entities/*/service.ts`) | 95-100% | Maintain |
| Workflow services (`core/identity/*/service.ts`) | 94-100% | Maintain |
| OAuth2 module (`core/oauth2/`) | Mixed (0-100%) | Improve with service-level tests |
| HTTP controllers, adapters | Covered by HTTP integration tests | — |

## Docker Services

Integration tests use Docker services defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Service    | Port      |
|------------|-----------|
| MySQL      | 3306      |
| PostgreSQL | 5432      |
| Redis      | 6379      |
| Vault      | 8090      |
| LDAP       | 389 / 636 |
